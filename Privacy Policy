Privacy Policy
Last Updated: [Insert Date]

This Privacy Policy explains how aw-amanda.github.io ("I," "me," or "my") collects, uses, and protects information provided by users ("you" or "your") when visiting my digital portfolio website (the "Site"). By using this Site, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy.

1. Information I Collect
This Site does not require account creation or logins. The only personal information I may collect is what you voluntarily provide through the Google-hosted contact form, including:

Your name

Your email address

Your message (if you choose to submit one)

I do not automatically collect cookies, tracking data, or analytics. This Site does not use ads, and I do not sell or share your information with third parties for marketing purposes.

2. How I Use Your Information
If you submit a message via the contact form, your information will only be used to:

Respond to your inquiry (if requested).

Communicate regarding potential collaborations (if applicable).

Your data will not be used for newsletters, promotions, or any other purpose without your explicit consent.

3. Third-Party Services
This Site includes links to external platforms (LinkedIn, GitHub, Blogger, etc.), which have their own privacy policies. I am not responsible for their data practices.

The contact form is hosted by Google Forms, meaning Google may process submissions under its Privacy Policy. I do not store your contact details outside of Google’s system unless explicitly needed for follow-up.

4. Data Retention & Security
Submitted contact information will be retained only as long as necessary to address your inquiry.

I implement reasonable security measures to protect your data but cannot guarantee absolute security (as no online transmission is 100% secure).

5. Your Rights
Since I do not collect or store data beyond voluntary messages, you may:

Request details about any information you’ve submitted.

Ask for deletion of your contact form submissions (email awilliamson@awdevsolutions.org).

6. Changes to This Policy
I may update this Privacy Policy periodically. The "Last Updated" date at the top will reflect changes. Continued use of the Site constitutes acceptance of revisions.

7. Contact Me
