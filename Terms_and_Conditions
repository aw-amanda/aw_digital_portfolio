The information provided when using the Services is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject us to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the Services from other locations do so on their own initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.

This Site serves as a personal platform to showcase my professional work and does not sell products, host advertisements, or require user accounts. All content, including text, images, and code, is my intellectual property unless otherwise stated, and unauthorized reproduction, distribution, or commercial use is prohibited.

I am not responsible for their content or data practices. If you choose to contact me using the Google-hosted contact form, you acknowledge that the information you provide—such as your name, email address, and message—will only be used to respond to your inquiry. Data submitted through the form is processed by Google in accordance with its Privacy Policy, and I do not retain this information outside of Google’s systems unless necessary for follow-up communication.

In compliance with privacy laws, including the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), Colorado Privacy Act (CPA), Utah Consumer Privacy Act (UCPA), Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (VCDPA), and Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), you retain certain rights regarding your data. Under these laws, you may request access to, correction of, or deletion of any personal information you have submitted. Since I do not sell, trade, or monetize user data, and no tracking technologies (such as cookies or analytics) are used on this Site, your interactions remain private and minimal.

I disclaim liability for any inaccuracies in Site content, third-party actions, or data breaches beyond my control, such as incidents involving Google Forms. These Terms may be updated periodically, with the "Last Updated" date reflecting any changes. Continued use of the Site constitutes acceptance of the revised terms. Any disputes related to this Site will be governed by Pennsylvania law and resolved in the appropriate courts of Cambria County.
